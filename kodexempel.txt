__________________________________________

The language is written in clear text that is easy for a beginner to understand and use to learn the basics of programming structure.
Equations are written as one normally would, except with the prefix: equation().

any words written inside < and > are placeholders and can be replaced with whatever the user wishes.

Target audience:        Beginners.
Structure:              Imperative
                        Procedural.

Kodexempel:

create program

  #create a function
  create function "<name>(<variable0>, <variable1>)"
    if <variable0> is string
      exit function
    end if
    return <variable0> + <variable1>
  end function "<name>"

  #call a function
  call function "<name>"

  #create a variable
  create variable/<type> "<name>"

  create variable/int digit
  create variable/string "string"

  #setting a variable to a number
  set "digit" to 5

  #adding to a int
  add 7 to "digit"

  #multiplying a int
  multiply "digit" by 5
  multiply 5 by "digit"

  #substract a int
  subtract 5 from "digit"

  #set a variable to be the result of an equation.
  set "digit" to equation((5+3)x7)

  #setting a variable to a string
  set "string" to 'this is a string'

  #syntax of an if-statement.
  #if else
    #if "<variable>" is <statement> then
      #<statements>
    #else
      #<statements>
  #end if

  if "digit" is equal to 7 then
    loop until "digit" equals 10
      add 1 to "digit"
    end loop
    else if "digit" is greater than 10 then
      loop until "digit" equals 10
      subtract 1 from "digit"
    end loop
  end if

  #printing statements
  print "<text>" -> print 'hello world'
  print digit

  #request input from user. 
  #strings need quotation-marks.
  #digits do not.
  request "<variable/string>"
  request <variable/digit>


end program
