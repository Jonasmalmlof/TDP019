The language is written in clear text that is easy for a beginner to understand and use to learn the basics of programming structure.
Equations are written as one normally would, except with the prefix: equation().

any words written inside < and > are placeholders and can be replaced with whatever the user wishes.

Target audience:        Beginners.
Structure:              Imperative,
                        Procedural.


_______ Code example: ________________________

create program

  #create a function
  create function "<name>"
    return “<returned_variable>”
  end function "<name>"

  #call a function
  #automatically creates a variable “<returned_variable>” that is used.
  #without needing to do: “<variable>” = call function “<name>”
  call function "<name>"

  #create a variable
  create variable/<type> "<name>"

  create variable/int "digit"
  create variable/string "string"

  #setting a variable to a number
  set digit to 5

  #adding to an int
  add 7 to "digit"

  #multiplying an int
  multiply "digit" by 5
  multiply 5 by "digit"

  #substract from an int
  subtract 5 from "digit"

  #setting a variable to be equal to an equation
  set "digit" to equation((5+3) x 7)

  #setting a variable to a string
  set "string" to 'this is a string'

  #if else-statement
  #if "<variable>" is <statement> then
    #<blabla>
  #else
    #<blabla>
  #end if


  if "digit" is equal to 7 then
    loop until "digit" is equal to 10
      add 1 to "digit"
    end loop
  else if "digit" is greater than 10 then
    loop until "digit" is greater than 10
      subtract 1 from "digit"
    end loop
  end if

  #printing statements
  print '<text>' -> print 'hello world'
  print "digit"

end program
