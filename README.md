# TDP019
Course: TDP019 at LiTH, Programming Language Creation.

# EasyCode

By Denis Ivan Blažević and Jonas Malmlöf.

# Purpose

This course was/is about working in pairs to create our own programming language.

We attempted to create a programming language that would be easy to pick up and use normal every day English syntax, that would subtly guide a new programmer to understand more complex languages.
